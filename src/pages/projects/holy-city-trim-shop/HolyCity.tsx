The caricature logo was designed to resemble the client's physical features and attitudeâ€”it is currently being used on clothing and other marketing materials. The secondary logo was designed with less detail so that it could be reproduced for stamping his brand into materials used for projects, thus leaving a special trademark of quality on his work."

The caricature logo captures the client's distinctive features and attitude, while the secondary logo was designed specifically for practical applications like leather stamping. The process involved multiple rounds of refinement to ensure each logo was unique, polished, and perfectly suited for its intended use."
